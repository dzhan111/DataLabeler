And this image we can see why the street in what seems like to be a major city. There are about two inches of snow. We can see in the foreground a person wearing a scarf and walking two dogs, one of which is a bulletproof fever and a slug is in the other dog which is black and gay. There are two pigeons in the background and there seem to be two people for the living background. There are a lot of buildings in the photo, one of which is, has green color to it and the rest of the buildings seem to be beige and brown. There are a lot of trees but none of them have leaves. The weather seems to be overcast in that photo. There seems to be two flash bins and a bunch of benches with snow on them. There are two street lights that seem to be of all style in the photo.
