# DataLabeler Documentation

## Note for Crowd Contributors

If you are a user, you do not have to set up any of these services. We have deployed them on the web and they are available to the public. Please check the [instructions doc](../README.md) for how to contribute.

## Environment Setup

You will need to sign up for the services we use to host our website. A link to each will be provided in the [instructions doc](../README.md) under the **Tech Stack** section. Then, you will need to add the appropriate keys to a .env file following the specification in the [example](../.env.example). Note that the ADMIN_KEY can be set to any arbitrary string, and that the ENV_TYPE variable sets the environment to dev mode when either `dev` or `test` are used.
